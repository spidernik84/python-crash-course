# # 1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
# 5-3. Alien Colors
# • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
# • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)


alien_color = "blue"

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("Congrats, you won 5 points!")
